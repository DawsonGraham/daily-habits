## Synopsis

Phase 3 Final Group Project. Welcome to Habits a daily journaling application that allows users to log daily activity via texting and mobile app interface.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

When you query the habits of many highly successful people, one common denominator stands out - journaling and taking the time to reflect daily. We set out to create an easy way to keep track of your tendencies and reactions to the things most important to you throughout your day. We aimed to make it simple and versatile enough to respond to with a simple text, yet robust enough to provide meaningful data on your habits.

## Usage

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
